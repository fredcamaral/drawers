/**
 * The `./tui` surface entry (Task 8.3.3) — the native workflows viewer.
 *
 * opencode loads a TUI plugin from `pkg.json.exports["./tui"]` and `import()`s it
 * in the UNSANDBOXED TUI process (full Bun fs access). This module is the entry:
 * it registers a full-screen `workflows` route (Phases | Agents | Detail) and a
 * `palette`-namespace `workflows.open` command, both driven by the pure 8.3.1
 * reducer fed by the 8.3.2 tailer — the JSX (`route.tsx`) stays thin (layout +
 * signal wiring), every derivation comes from the pure modules.
 *
 * Data resolution: the viewer READS the same `<dataDir>/workflow-feed` the engine
 * WRITES, and the same `<dataDir>/workflow-control` the engine POLLS for cancel
 * sentinels — both off the ONE canonical base from `resolveDataBaseDir` (core), so
 * there is a single resolution algorithm across both plugin surfaces and no
 * protocol between them (Phase 8 binding decision: the feed file is the bus).
 *
 * Pinned-version note (Phase 8 TUI surface risk): this surface is built and tested
 * against opencode `1.16.2` (`@opencode-ai/plugin@1.16.2`) with opentui
 * `@opentui/core`/`@opentui/keymap`/`@opentui/solid` ALL pinned to EXACTLY `0.3.2`
 * (the versions the pinned opencode ships, read from its lockfile catalog). The
 * published `PluginModule.tui?: never` type pins `tui` OUT on the SERVER module,
 * but the runtime accepts it; the TUI-specific `TuiPluginModule` from
 * `@opencode-ai/plugin/tui` is the correct type and sidesteps the lag — which is
 * why the default export is typed `satisfies TuiPluginModule`, NOT the server
 * `PluginModule`. Treat breakage on host/opentui bumps as expected maintenance.
